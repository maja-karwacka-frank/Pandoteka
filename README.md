 **Pandoteka is a database of books that allows users to search for titles they are interested in, check details about the books, add them to their wishlist, and even go to a site where they can buy them. Website's users can add and check comments on the selected book, and even rate the titles using the one and only panda scale.**

 **A non-logged-in user only has access to the search engine and books details. Wishlist, comments and rating system are available only to logged-in members.**
